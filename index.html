                    <h2>“Scientists are one step closer to testing ancient skeletons for pregnancy”</h2>

                    <p>Scientists say they have found a way to test ancient human remains for hormones linked with
                        pregnancy, a breakthrough that may allow archaeologists to determine whether a woman was
                        pregnant or had recently given birth at the time of her death. Researchers found key
                        reproductive hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in hard tissues, such as the bones
                        and teeth, of skeletons dating back as far as 1,000 years, according to a study published
                        October 2 in the Journal of Archaeological Science.</p>

                        <h3>“Six species of North American bats glow under UV light, adding to growing list of
                            fluorescent mammals”</h3>

                        <p>Glowing bats may sound like Halloween decor, but researchers in Georgia have discovered
                            certain species of North American bats that are capable of the unusual trick. When placed
                            under ultraviolet lighting, six species of the critters were found to emit a green
                            luminescence. It is the first record of the phenomenon in bats native to that part of the
                            world, according to an October 20 news release from the University of Georgia. The discovery
                            adds to the growing list of mammals that share the trait. But scientists still don’t know
                            why some furry animals glow while others do not. The findings were published in July in the
                            journal Ecology and Evolution.

                    <h4>What’s wrong with Wendy’s?</h4>
                    <p>New York — For a logo with a trademark grin, Wendy’s has little to smile about nowadays. The
                        burger chain’s stock has lost nearly 50% of its value this year. Wendy’s executive suite has
                        contended with several departures, and it’s currently operating without a permanent CEO after
                        its previous leader abruptly left after just a year-and-a-half on the job. Plus, a confusing mix
                        of promotions hurt sales last quarter.</p>

                    <h4>It’s scream season — why some love it and others have nightmares</h4>
                    <p>Do you love to scream at Halloween? Or are you, like me, a certified scaredy-cat who avoids
                        haunted houses and scary movies because my sleep depends on it? How you react to terror may lie
                        in how you engage the world, according to Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology
                        Research Center in Newport Beach, California, which conducts research to promote the use of
                        media for positive social change.</p>
